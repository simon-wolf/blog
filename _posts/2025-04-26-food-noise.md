One of the YouTube channels I have started watching recently is [Mark Lewis's](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkLewisfitness). He is generally very fit and healthy but he has a non-visible problem which is something I also have, and so do a lot of other people. It's the problem of food addiction or, as he also calls it, food noise.

Mark has posted a handful of videos about "fat jabs" and his experience of taking Mounjaro for a few months. In those videos he talked about his food addiction and how the drug helps deaden the desire to eat. A few days ago he posted [a quick update](https://youtu.be/T5ksucVTIFY) about how life has been since he stopped taking it. In that video he gave an example of what food noise is and I wanted to quote it because I find it entirely relatable:

"I've stood in my kitchen at thee o'clock in the morning feeling physically sick, having over-eaten all day, and just stared longingly at my wife's three bars of cooking chocolate, wondering if it tastes just like chocolate."

I've not been inclined to try "fat jabs" and, for me, not having unhealthy snacks in the house tends to be enough. I think I'm lucky but I'm also aware that food noise is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. You can be fit and healthy and still crave random foods, whether they be good or bad, in excess.
