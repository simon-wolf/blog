title: It's Not A Journey

I sat down to start drafting a blog post about the personal changes I've made over the last few months and realised I've been thinking about it, and calling it, a journey. It's not.

A journey implies that there is a destination... an end point. What I am doing by changing what I eat and taking regular exercise does not have a definitive end. I will reach a weight I am happy with and I will achieve a body shape I am happy with and then my focus will change to maintaining it.

What I won't do is stop. I won't go back to sitting on the sofa eating bags of crisps or packets of sweets and I won't go back to not taking any exercise (as long as I am physically able). There will be bad days, maybe bad weeks or months, but they will be temporary.

In the same way that I became a non-smoker back in 2000, I've embraced a change which helps my physical health, and, in this case, my mental health too. It is something I wish I had done earlier in my life but I'm doing it now and that is what matters.

25 years ago I thought I had quit smoking whereas I was a non-smoker. Today I've realised that I am not on a journey, I live healthily.
