Just over a week ago I did something to my foot and ankle whilst I was out for a run. It's taken me until today to feel confident enough that it had healed to go running again. And I had was what I would consider to be my first bad run.

I felt really tired and defeated when I got home and had walked for some short segments. Apart from during my first Parkrun when I was running with friends and started off too fast, this was the first time it had happened on a solo run since walking was part of the planned routine during the Couch to 5K plan. I was hot, tired and for some reason really disappointed in myself.

Two hours later, after a long bath and some food, I'm feeling better about it all and this blog post is largely a reminder to me about a few key things...

## Gut Feelings Can Be Wrong

My goal had been to do a fairly gentle run (around the 7:30/7:45 per kilometre pace) and to cover six or seven kilometres. Looking at the stats my watch recorded, by the time I'd finished I'd covered 5.3 km in 39:19, a pace of around 7:23. So the distance was a bit short but the average pace was about right. I thought I'd had a horrible run but the stats don't back that up.

Whilst I did walk at times, looking at a chart of my run, I also exceeded my target pace when I was running. I definitely need to get better at slow running.

And I also think that probably the heat and the poor sleep I've had over the last few nights because of it meant that I was just tired anyway and this was never going to be a great run.

## Remember Where I Started

I need to keep some perspective about all of this. It was only four and a half months ago that I started running and before February this year I'd not taken any regular exercise for over 20 years. At the start of 2025 I had just turned 52 and was 25 to 30 kg overweight. So far I've lost 18 kg and can now run 5k fairly comfortably and am going to be doing a 10k event in December.

Old me would have just slumped on the sofa this evening whereas I went out for a run. I need to remember that every run is a good run.

## Embrace The Technology

I'm a data nerd and love gadgets so one of my purchases which I didn't really need was my Garmin Fenix 7. Today is one of those rare cases where I can say that it was worth the expense because the data from my run has helped show me that what I felt was a bad run actually wasn't. That definitely helped lift my mood.

Actually it's not fair of me to say that this is a rare case. My Garmin is great for tracking runs and for telling me my pace at regular intervals and telling me if I am on track with whatever goals I have set for a run. I could have gone with a cheaper model but I have zero regrets about getting a Fenix.

## I Sometimes Need A 'Bad' Run

I suppose that I need days like today to help me put things back into perspective. To make me realise how far I have come in just a few months. To make me realise that every run in a good run compared to being sedentary. To remind me that I am not competing with anyone else and that sometimes walking or taking things easy is just normal and actually something which can be a good thing.

Nobody is judging me and I need to be less hard on myself, particularly when this is for fun and for mental health as much as it is for my physical wellbeing.
