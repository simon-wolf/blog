In four months I turn 48. I am 5'8" (173 cm) and weight 15st 10lb (100kg). I am unfit and have a very sedentary lifestyle because I work from home as a software developer and spend most of my days sitting at a desk. My BMI is 33.4 when it should be between 18.5 and 25 and my weight should be between 55.4kg and 74.8kg. Essentially I need to lose between a quarter and half of my weight.

It's not all doom and gloom however. I stopped smoking just over 20 years ago and I drink so rarely that I might as well be considered teetotal.

A little over two years ago I hit a personal worst weight of 117kg and managed to get down to 87kg before piling weight back on due to complacency and inactivity. The weight loss bit wasn't even very hard but keeping the weight off has proven to be.

I am going to try a two-pronged approach this time. As well as being more careful about what I eat I need to improve my fitness and then keep myself fit. And of course, exercise will help with the weight loss and management too.

I, like quite a few people in the UK and probably around the world, am getting back on a bike. You can read about that in my post about [choosing a bicycle](https://www.swwritings.com/post/2020-09-13-choosing-a-new-bike).
