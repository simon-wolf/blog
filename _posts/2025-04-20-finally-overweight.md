This morning I did my weekly weigh-in and I was down to 89.5 KG. Apart from being below 90 KG (I was by a whisker last week) it also means, according to the [NHS BMI calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-body-mass-index/), that my BMI is now 29.9... I am no longer obese and have just crept into the overweight category.

However BMI is [not a great way](https://www.bodyvolume.com/post/why-bmi-is-outdated-and-inaccurate) to measure health but is is a quick and simple yardstick. So I decided to check my [waist-to-hip ratio](https://www.healthline.com/health/waist-to-hip-ratio) and I have a value of just below 1 (or bang on 1 depending on where I think my waist is) so am on the boundary of moderate health risk and high health risk. This corresponds with how I feel I am doing... better than I was but with quite a way to go.

But I am making progress and I am edging out of the higher risk zones of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio which is hugely encouraging and so the journey continues.
