This evening I climbed off my Zwift Ride and grinned. Since it arrived at the end of January, I'd cycled over 1,000 kilometres on it.

In the grand scheme of things this isn't a huge distance. If I was cycling from Land's End to John o'Groats ([LEJOG](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog/)) I would be around the border between England and Scotland and a little over half way there.

But for someone who was not taking any exercise prior to starting indoor cycling it feels amazing!

I've climbed 8,100 metres -- another 849m and I've cycled up Everest. I've burnt around 16,000 calories thanks to almost 40 hours cycling, and I've had an enormous amount of fun doing it all.

The added bonus, of course, is that I'm getting fitter and healthier too and I have learnt the lesson that, with a bit of willpower and discipline, you really can achieve what feels like an impossible lifestyle change.
