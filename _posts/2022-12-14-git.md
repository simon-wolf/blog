This blog post is a personal reference in that I wanted to document the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commands I use the most now that I use the command line more and more. I am publishing it as a blog post so that I can refer back to it quickly and easily. It is not a complete guide and is likely to be updated regularly.

# Branching

Lists the local and remote branches.

`git checkout -b <new-branch>`

`git checkout <branch>`

`git branch -d <branch>`

Deletes the specified branch but only if all changes have been merged.

`git branch -D <branch>`

Force deleted the specified branch.

`git push origin -d <branch>`

Deletes the specified remote branch but only if all changes have been merged.

`git branch -m <branch>`

Renames the current branch to `<branch>`.
