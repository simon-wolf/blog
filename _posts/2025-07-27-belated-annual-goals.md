I usually dislike the idea of setting goals around the start of the year because they are very rarely kept and then it just becomes miserable looking back on how many you failed to achieve.

However early in 2025 I changed my lifestyle and started eating better (cooking from scratch more, eating more fruit and vegetables, stopped eating sweets and crisps and other snacks) and doing some exercise (indoor cycling, running and CrossFit). I want a way to track my progress and to allow me to track goals and achievements and that seems to fit into the idea of maintaining annual pages about it all.

Unlike more usual goals lists, I intend for mine to be focused on health and fitness. I will update then during each year and really they will be a mix of things to aspire to and a log of what I have achieved.

And so, despite being over half way through 2025, I have added a new Fitness Goals section with [a page for 2025]({% link goals_2025.md %}) and I intend to keep it updated as and when I add or complete goals (or if things go horribly wrong!) and will probably link to it in related posts to make it easier to track changes.
