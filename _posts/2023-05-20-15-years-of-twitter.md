Today marks 15 years since I signed up for Twitter according to a notification they pushed to me.

It seemed like the perfect time to delete my account, partly so that I am in no way supporing what is becoming more and more a toxic environment, partly to stop me casually checking in and getting depressed or enraged by the posts their algorithm suggest to me, and partly to stop friends from sending me DMs which I am usually slow to respond to because I was not checking things regularly.

As I [posted on Mastodon](https://social.sgawolf.com/@simon/110401847039194961), it was a sad and hard decision because over the years Twitter has given me so much laughter, friendship, and jobs and it has also helped me learn so much about myself, the world and the technologies that are part of my work life.

Maybe Facebook will be next...
