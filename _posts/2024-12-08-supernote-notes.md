These notes are my personal notes about using the [Supernote A6 X2 Nomad](https://supernote.com/products/supernote-nomad).

They will be updated regularly as I add more things I want to refer back to. They will also act as an index to related blog posts about the Nomad.

## Gestures

The device has sidebars on the left and right and their "role" swaps depending on whether you have the device set up for a lieft-handed or right-handed person. Therefore they will be referred to the the primary and secondary sidebars (primary is the one on the right in right-handed mode and on the left in left-handed mode).

| Function | Gesture |
| -------- | ------- |
| Show the sidebar menu | Primary sidebar swipe down |
| Refresh the screen | Primary sidebar swipe up |
| Show the top menu bar | Swipe down from top of screen |
| Undo | Secondary sidebar swipe up |
| Redo | Secondary sidebar swipe down |
| Activate region eraser | Two-finger hold on secondary sidebar |
| Activate lasso | Two-finger hold on screen |
| Return to page before jump | One-finger swipe up in top half |
| Toggle toolbar | Two-finger double-tap |
