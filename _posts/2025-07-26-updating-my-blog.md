A few days ago I write a post about [blogging services](2025-07-23-simple-blogging/) where I summarised suggestions for simple blogging services after a friend asked me for recommendations. Whilst I was doing that I decided that my blog needed a bit of a refresh and general tidy-up.

I am now using a theme called [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/). I will shortly (maybe by the time you read this) subscribe to thank Dean.

I also decided to clean up the categories I'd created for my posts and now have fewer of them. However, so that there is still some granularity I have added tags. I'm still feeling both out a bit so there may be some changes and if you think I have miscategorised or badly tagged something then please let me know.

The RSS feed has also been tweaked so apologies if your feed reader shows posts you have already seen.

Finally, I have edited the Projects page to try to make it a bit clearer.

If you have any problems or spot anything weird please shout!
