title: Size of a Supernote

I've been asked about the size of the [Supernote](https://supernote.com/products/supernote-nomad) and the screen area by a couple of people so here are some photos which might help.

The Supernote in its folio case is about the same size as a [Moleskine Classic Notebook](https://www.moleskine.com/en-gb/black-friday/notebooks/classic-notebook-black-9788883701122.html) (13x21cm), just a little shorter vertically:

The Supernote in a folio is slightly thinner than a Moleskine Notebook:

The Supernote screen area is smaller than a Moleskine Notebook page however, particularly vertically:

For comparison, the screen area on a [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) is about the same height as the Moleskine Notebook and a little wider:

I used to use [Rhodia No. 16](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_orange_16.php) notepads a lot and the screen area of the Supernote is smaller but not particularly noticably when in use:

I'm not sure if it is a configuration thing but when I read a PDF or epub on the reMarkable there is a lot of whitespace around it which means that the visible reading area is not hugely larger than the Supernote's despite the much larger screen size. This photo shows a PDF but an epub still has big left and right margins:
