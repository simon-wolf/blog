## Overview

I've decided to track the video games I play, the books I read and the films and TV shows I swtch this year. I always get to the end of a year and remember playing, reading and watching some great things but usually cannot remember which year they were in. Hopefully this will help. I may rate things as I finish them too.

## Video Games

My backlog is much bigger than the one listed below but this year I am going to try to focus on playing through some of the RPGs since it is a genre I love but tend not to play enough because the games can be really time consuming.

### In Progress

* **Octopath Traveller** [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-1275922.html) _(Nintendo Switch)_ Started in 2021 and played to the end of the first chapter for each character.
* **Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age – Definitive Edition** [<i class="fa fa-link"></i>](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/DRAGON-QUEST-XI-S-Echoes-of-an-Elusive-Age-Definitive-Edition-1514406.html) _(Nintendo Switch)_ Started in 2023 and played until I had the first two orbs.

## Reading

I have a massive backlog of books on my Kindle but, unlike with the games, it is more realistic to just list what I am currently reading and what I think might be next.

## Films & TV Shows

These lists are going to be more reactive than planned since there are very few films I am looking forward to or series I am in the middle of.
