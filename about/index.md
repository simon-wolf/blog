My name is Simon Wolf. By day I am an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) developer and before that was a macOS and iOS developer but I satarted my career as a Windows developer.

I work for [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) but still have my own company, [Otter Software](https://www.ottersoftware.com), and I live in England in a small village in the Mendip Hills. My nearest town is [Frome](http://www.discoverfrome.co.uk/frome/), famed for its independent shops, great markets and [Festival](http://www.fromefestival.co.uk) amongst other things.

You can find me on Twitter as [@sgaw](https://twitter.com/sgaw).

You can find my open-source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ottersoftware) but if you use any of my source code in your projects then please review the [license agreement](https://swwritings.com/licenseagreement) first.
