My name is Simon Wolf and I have been an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) developer since 2019. Before that was a macOS and iOS developer but I satarted my career as a Windows developer back in the mid-1990s.

I run a family business, [Mindme](https://mindme.care), with my sister and I live in England in a small village in the Mendip Hills in Somerset. My nearest town is [Frome](http://www.discoverfrome.co.uk/frome/), famed for its independent shops, great markets and [Festival](http://www.fromefestival.co.uk) amongst other things.

You can find me on Twitter as [@sgaw](https://twitter.com/sgaw) and on Mastodon as [@simon@social.sgawolf.com](https://social.sgawolf.com/@simon).
