## Learning How To Use Text

### [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)

**July 2025:** The current status is that this is on-hold until I need to create a new type of document and will spend time tinkering with it all.

**Background:** Last year I started learning LaTeX because I wanted to standardise the look of my company's policies and contracts. Being able to track changes in what are just text files was also hugely appealing. As of right now we have all of our policy documents and business-to-business contracts as LaTeX files.

### [Neovim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Neovim)

**June 2025:** I followed a set of videos by [Mr Jakob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1gyYttzxcI&list=PLy68GuC77sURrnMNi2XR1h58m674KOvLG) about setting up Neovim from scratch with the sorts of plugins that I need to replace VS Code. 

**Background:** I write code for a living and like a lot of other developers I use [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code). It's good but I have a weird desire to use Neovim although it is a long, slow learning curve.

### [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

**June 2025:** I've just started to look at Emacs and am largely using [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) as my initial guide.

**Background:** Exactly like Neovim above, I want to explore Emacs as an alternative to Visual Studio Code. I like Neovim but it feels like it is a text editor with extras bolted on to allow you to create your own integrated development environment and I wonder if Emacs will be more cohesive.

### [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) For Data Parsing

**May 2025:** Used AWK to process a CSV data export from Pocket and generate a list of Markdown links ([blog post](https://blog.sgawolf.com/post/2025-05-22-pocket-parser)).

**Background:** Being able to parse a plain text file and extract or summarise data or calculate totals is incredibly useful. I'm still a beginner with AWK really buy enjoy using it every time I find an excuse to do so.

## Learning How To Use Technology

Coming as soon as I have found an excuse to buy one.

## Health & Wellbeing

### Running A Marathon

**July 2025:** For weeks and weeks, I have been failing to take part in my first Parkrun. The problem isn't running 5K, it's getting up early enough on a Saturday to get to the start on time.

**Background:** Between April and June 2025 I did the [Couch to 5K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch_to_5K) plan. After completing it I had the ambitious idea to run a marathon, ideally the London Marathon, in 2028 to celebrate turning 55.

## Eco Homes

**Background:** I have a yearning to buy some land and have an eco home built for myself.
