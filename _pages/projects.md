Like a lot of people I have a number of non-work projects, maybe some even best described as passions. This page acts as a summary of what I am currently interested in and will provide some idea about the sorts of things I might write about on my blog.

## Text Over Proprietary Formats

I have a preference to use text files rather than proprietary formats such as Microsoft Word, task management and note-taking apps, etc.

This largely manifests itself in posts in the blog about things like [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) (a text editor), [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (a document typesetting language), [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (a data-parsing tool), or [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (a way to format plain text files).

## Health & Wellbeing

I changed my lifestyle at the start of 2025 and started eating better and exercising more. My initial goals were to loose weight and to get fitter. Blog posts about this are in the [Health](/categories/#health) category.

## Physical Media

Ever since I was a child in my teens when my parents bought our first [VCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder) I have loved collecting recordings, although most back then would have been tapes of things recorded from TV.

In the mid-1990s I started buying DVDs and over the next decade built up a pretty good collection of films and TV shows and the VHS tapes were slowly but steadily replaced.

By the late 2000s I, like most of the world had moved on to digital media and was buying my TV shows and films from Apple.

And then at the start of 2020 I started falling out of love with Apple's ecosystem and, whilst I still use an iPhone and have an iPad, moving from macOS to Linux made me realise the my collection of over 500 films wasn't really mine and it was tied to their devices.

And so I started buying DVDs and, for the first time, Blu-rays. And then I started buying a few music CDs (I've never been massively into music but do listen to it in the car) and my daughter getting a record player prompted me to buy a few vinyls too.

And now I am a massive advocate of physical media and I love finding films and TV shows to add to my collection. Sometimes they are new releases, sometimes they are hard-to-find titles which are now out of print, sometimes they scratch a nostalgia itch, and sometimes they are Steelbook releases which are bought just because they are beautiful, collectable, or titles I love and just want a special version of.

## Retro Tech

I grew up in the era when home computers were new and still a bit niche. My computer history is an Acorn Electron, Commodore 128, Amiga 500, Amiga 1500 and then into the PC era in the mid 1990s. It all felt quite magical at the time and is something I am very nostalgic about.

As I get older I find myself drawn to things like using text-based applications in a terminal. I'm writing this on a 13 year old Lenovo ThinkPad X220 (which has a beautiful keyboard) in Neovim, a text-only editor.

I also still play video games and, whilst I play a few new titles close to launch, I play a lot of older titles, whether they are ones from the near-past which I still own or much older ones which I play via emulators.

As of writing this I am on the verge of getting a [Trimui Brick](https://trimui.net/en-eu/collections/trimui-brick) to help me capture some of the feel of the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance era which I loved and I am also going to start playing with the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy console designed for making, playing and sharing tiny games and other programs. Blog posts will inevitably follow.

## Eco Homes

I have an itch to buy some land and have an eco home built to my specification. This may be one of those things that always remains an aspiration but I would like, by 2025, to have at least properly explored the possibilities of if, ranging from finding the land to the costs involved and maybe even sketching out some ideas for the house itself.

The ideal of designing and commissioning and then living in "my house" for the rest of my life is hugely appealing to someone like me who prefers stability over change.
