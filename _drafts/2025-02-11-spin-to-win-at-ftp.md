title: Spin To Win At FTP
categories: health
---

FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is a measure of fitness. It is the power you can maintain for an hour, measured in watts. And my only real interest in it at the moment is because it is the method Zwift uses to tailor workouts. If you FPT is too low then they will be too easy and if it is too high then they will be too hard. It is also a good single metric to monitor to see how your riding improves.

Whilst Zwift does attempt to auto-detect FTP it is still recommended that you do an FTP test so I did. I opted for the Ramp Test Lite one which is most suited to light (under 60 kg) or new cyclists (if you expect your FTP to be below 175 watts). The idea is that the test starts with a warm-up period and then, starting from a low target, you are asked to increase the power you are exerting every minute, with the power requirements increasing by 10 watts each time.

## The Tasmanian Devil

It was last Saturday afternoon that I tried the test and found it all a bit weird and confusing. During the arm up I was pedalling at around 85 RPM, a cadence I feel pretty comfortable at. But when the test actually started the resistance seemed to drop away and I found myself spinning the pedals at increasingly faster speeds to try to achieve the watts needed. It all felt very weird and at one point I peaked at 125 RPM and pictured myself as being like the cartoon character The Tasmanian Devil. I fiddled around with a mysterious percentage value I could change via the usual gear changing buttons and spent quite a lot of time at 125% in the vain hope that it was helping somehow.

When I finally ran out of steam I'd achieved 14 stars by completing the levels up to 170 watts for one minute and Zwift awarded me an FTP of 120 (although Zwift Power reports that my FTP is set to 192).

## The Community Rescue

Fortunately I posted about my results in a Discord channel where someone mentioned that the idea is to ride at the cadence you want and then the Zwift Ride will adjust the resistance so that the power output matches the target. Because there is a slight delay in this happening, "you panic and pedal faster, which makes resistance lower, and then you worry and pedal even faster." Apparently the reverse also happens and if you drop your cadence then the torque requirements increase which makes it harder to pedal.

Essentially I'd done it all wrong and the key is to pedal at your chosen cadence and try to maintain it. As the steps in the test progress your cadence will drop and you will end up grinding (slower pedalling and pushing more power through your legs) and eventually you just have to stop.
