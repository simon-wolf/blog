Six months after [I first wrote about Zwift]({% post_url 2025-02-08-zwift-setup-and-first-impressions %}) I thought it would be good to write about my longer-term thoughts. I've had a bit of an on-off relationship with Zwift, some caused by it and some caused by me and other external factors, and hopefully this will help me rationalise it and it may also be helpful for others too.

## Likes and Dislikes

It's fairly easy for me to write down the things I like and the things I am less keen on with Zwift:

**Likes**

* The gamification of Zwift (and I'm including all of the stats, goals and performance tracking here) is a big plus for someone like me. I love the data Zwift generates and that I can see my PRs, race against my 'ghost' to try to beat them, can track routes I've ridden, etc. It all helps motivate me and gives me mini-goals to achieve.

* Going for a Zwift ride is incredbly easy. I have my Zwift Ride set up in a permanent location and so I can jump on and go for a ride with very little friction. The helps remove any excuses and also means that I can fit in a ride when time is limited. Being indoor cycling it also means that the weather is never a consideration... well unless it is ferociously hot when even my fan struggles, particularly since my setup is in a south-facing room.

* The workout plans are great for both improving fitness and performance and also for providing a structure and plan for when you need to ride (more on this below).

* The community is great and that covers the general Zwift riding community where a stranger will give you a "Ride On" shout of encouragement, the clubs where group rides and races are arranged, or the Discord servers where like-minded people can swap advice, be encouraging and supportive and become friend who you go on a more sociable ride with.

* The variety of activities is excellent. I can go for a casual ride, do a workout, join a race, ride a flat route, ride up a mountain, follow a pacer, etc. There is an awful lot you can do and so I've never been bored.

**Dislikes**

* I had a pretty good bike fit until I got a more professional bike fit which never really clicked with me. My physical form might have looked better but it was not comfortable and I'm now tweaking it again to try to find a good compromise. My main issue has been knee pain but sore wrist and hands indicate that I'm putting too much weight on my arms too.

* After six months I still tend to struggle with longer rides on the standard saddle and I now mentally separate this from the overall bike fit. I need to try some other saddles but I know that this is a bit of pot luck so I'm procrastinating!

## Not Riding Regularly

As of right now I've not done much Zwift riding for a few weeks. I rode regularly (two or three times a week) until the end of May and then things fell off a cliff due to an injury and then, well, other things. I haven't fallen out of love with Zwift, it is more that other things have taken over my exercise regime, at least for now.

During February and March I was tending to do two Zwift training plan rides each week and then two or three other rides which tended to be a bit of a mix of sociable group rides and me just riding and exploring Watopia.

In April I started the Couch to 5K plan which required three runs each week. The two Zwift training plan rides filled out most of the rest of the week so I would usually do one group ride at the weekend and have a rest day.

I June I finished both the Zwift training plan and the Couch to 5K plan and the loss of my routine resulted in me [loosing focus and direction]({% post_url 2025-02-08-zwift-setup-and-first-impressions %}). I rebuilt it around starting two CrossFit sessions each week (which I badly needed to help introduce some strength training and improve my flexibility) and by running more, particularly after deciding to do a 10K run in December and starting a Garmin training plan which involves three or four runs each week. There isn't really much time for Zwift at the moment.

## A Side Note About Mental Health

As I have mentioned before in my blog posts, I am finding one of the biggest benefits of regular exercise is my improved mental health. But whilst CrossFit and Zwift give me a huge sense of achievement and a great endorphin hit it is running that had had the most benefit. For some reason, a 30 minute run is better for clearing my head than Zwift or CrossFit. Perhaps because I am slowly thinking less about the act of running and just giving my head more time to process "life" whereas with Zwift and CrossFit I still tend to think about the act of doing them more. It's very hard to let go of running at the moment because of this too.

## The Next Six Months

I can't predict what the next six monts will hold but I'm anticipating that I'll carry on with CrossFit and for the next couple of months focus more on running than Zwift whilst the weather (hopefully) remains reasonable and the evenings are still light enough to run without worrying about lights and high-vis. As soon as the weather turns I'm going to get back into Zwift.

But I have learnt that I need structure and routine and I cannot rely on Zwift training plans for that (although they help) so I will be tring to set myself some goals and seeing if I can easy myself into Zwift races and things like climbing challenges to give myself targets to achieve.

And I must also buy some new cycling shorts (my old one are too big which is good but they therefore bunch up and are not hugely comfortable any more) and I will probably buy at least one saddle to try out and do some tweaking of the bike's setup so that I can ride in comfort again.
