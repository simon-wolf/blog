This time last year I was spending a lot of time thinking about my own mortality and about how I needed to change my lifestyle. I knew I needed to do something, and had done for a long time, but actually starting the process was ridiculously difficult.

However, finally, in mid-January, I did and you can read about that [here]({% post_url 2025-02-08-changing-my-lifestyle %}). What I want to reflect on in this post is how looking ahead at a year feels like a very long time whereas living through that year, and particularly looking back on it, feels very different.

## The Long Road Ahead

When I started reading stories about weight loss and people changing their lifestyles it was always from the point of view of them having started their changes a year or more in the past. Being impatient for change, the thought of needing so much time to experience the sort of changes other have gone through feels like an eternity. Rather than being an impetus to start as soon as possible, for me it acted as a deterrent and I felt that it was overwhelming and almost impossible to tackle. "I need to do something urgently but I know it will take a long time so maybe it is too late to start. Maybe the status quo is okay."

In retrospect it feels and sounds ridiculous but I'll bet that most people have had chores which need to be done but because they are hard or will take a long time they end up being ignored for as long as possible. But, as with those cases, getting started is the hardest step and then it (usually) ends up being easier than expected.

Fortunately I had moments of clarity and I decided that the status quo really wasn't okay and even if nothing else happened I could change what I ate fairly easily and see how things went. I was worried, almost scared, of being hungry or missing treats I was used to but I decided that I needed to try and so I stopped buying crisps, sweets, unhealthy snacks, ready meals and as many ultra-processed foods as I could and focused on just eating better. I didn't have a plan and didn't count calories; I just thought I would see how it all went for a few weeks.

## The First Fortnight

I decided to weight myself weekly and I told myself not to panic if I didn't see immediate results. The trend is the important bit.

I started on 19 January and in the first week I lost 1.5 kg and then I lost another kilogram in the second week. I'd gone from 101.5 kg to 100.1 kg to 99.05 kg. I was below 100 kg. And then silly things started to occur to me... my stepladder has a recommended maximum weight of 100 kg so I was within range (if I ignored clothes and didn't carry anything on it).

But the main thing was seeing some results and that encouraged me. If I could lose a kilogram each week, at least initially, then I would be at 90 kg around mid-April. Suddenly I had a target weight and a timescale.

> I did in fact reach 89.95 kg on 13 April.

## Adding Exercise

At the end of January I invested in a [Zwift Ride](https://www.zwift.com/eu/zwift-ride-smart-bike) which was a big financial gamble for me. I had no idea if I would enjoy it and stick with it but I rationalised that if HMRC allow a [£0.45 mileage rate](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-travel-mileage-and-fuel-allowances/travel-mileage-and-fuel-rates-and-allowances) for business travel then I would "pay off" the Zwift Ride after 2,400 miles or 3,862 km (it cost me £1,080 and ignored the subscription fee, delivery cost, cost of accessories, etc.).

> As of today I have ridden 2,057 km so I am over half-way there.

The key thing for me was finding and signing up for a "Back to Fitness" training plan which runs for 12 weeks and involves two training sessions per week. I suddenly had a structured plan to last me through to the end of April. Rather than thinking that I should be fitter in three months, a whole quarter of a year away, I could focus on two activities a week and just work through them until the plan was complete. I wasn't looking at a distant goal, I had something immediate to do.

And then at the start of April I started the [Couch to 5K](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/get-active/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/) running plan which was a nine week plan. Again, rather than thinking about June and mid-summer I could focus on three runs each week and let the time take care of itself.

> I completed both plans and still enjoy both indoor cycling and running.

## Six Months And Beyond

By the time I had finished both the Zwift training plan and the Couch to 5K plan it was June and I was almost six months into my lifestyle changes. I'd started noticing the difference and those first few months had gone very quickly. My weight was down to 85kg and I was feeling fitter in general.

In late June I started doing CrossFit and so now I was mixing it with indoor cycling and running and was settling into a bit of a routine. The dieting was still going well and although the weight loss was slowing down I knew to just stick with things and see what happened.

I started looking forward to the future rather than worrying about it and how long or difficult it would be to reach future milestones. I was now enjoying the process rather than fearing it and because I had experienced a few months of seeing progress I knew that it was working.

## Almost A Year On

And so, 11 months on from when I started I can start to look back at the achievements and the milestones. I'm
