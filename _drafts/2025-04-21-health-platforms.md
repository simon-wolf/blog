title: Taming The Health Platforms
categories: health

When it comes to technology it is perfectly normal for different people use different platforms. A computer might might run Windows, macOS, or Linux. A smartphone might use iOS or Android. Documents can be saved to cloud services such as Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive. There is a lot of choice and a lot of variety.

Health and fitness technology is no different. There are a lot of platforms, technolgies and services available and, whilst choice is good, it can be overwhelming and it is possible to end up with data fragmented across several of them.

An awful lot of people might not experience this but for data nerds like me it presents a problem. How do you share data between different platforms so that you can have the bits you want in all the right places?

I was looking for a way to get my weekly weight measurements into Zwift and came across [FitnessSyncer](https://www.fitnesssyncer.com/).
