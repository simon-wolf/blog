title: From Impossible To Normal

I don't understand when people are not able to write document using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). I don't understand when people who think they will break their smartphones by doing something wrong in an app. I don't understand when people can't ride a bicycle. I don't understand when people can't do any of the things I find normal or easy or obvious.

I don't understand when people can eat in a restaurant alone. I don't understand when people are calm about a mechanical problem with their car and can fix it. I don't understand when people can jump out of a plane with a parachute. None of those things are normal or easy or obvious to me.

But everything I have mentioned can be learnt, or is something you can overcome a fear to achieve. Knowledge, experience and rational thought move things from the impossible to the normal.

But once it has become normal it is easy to quickly forget how hard it really was. The process of moving from the impossible to the normal probably wasn't easy and it might not have been quick. And this has been something I'm acutely aware of when I've been writing blog posts about my health and fitness. Before I could actually do something about it I needed a relatable example to follow. I didn't realise it as clearly as that at first but it was the key to allowing me to go from a helpless feeling of resignation about my situation to actually doing something about it. "If they can, so can I."

That help and encouragement is something I am very keen to pass on. It would be wonderful to help just one person realise that if I, aged 52, unfit and obese, can do something about my situation then they can too.

And when you are going from something impossible to something normal, it is the very first step that is the hardest. It is the very first step that needs explaining and normalising. And so my next blog post will document my first few sessions of the Couch to 5K plan.
