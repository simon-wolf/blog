title: Emacs?
categories: linux
---

I've decided to take a look at [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). This is despite my on-going project to learn how to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). But I've realised that the two are not necesarilly synonomous with Neovim being, at its heart, a text editor whilst Emacs is more of an 'operating system' which contains an editor.

I don't use a Desktop Environment on my computers. I don't have a graphical system like Windows, macOS, Gnome or KDE where I launch applications which open in floating windows that I can move around the screen, maximise or minimise or put behind another window. Instead I use a Windows Manager (SwayWM) where windows fill the screen unless I open another window in which case the screen is split and the two windows each fill half of the screen. If I open more windows they are tiled so that another window shrinks and the new ones fill the empty space. Windows can be resized and moved but the key concept is that windows don't float and they don't sit in front of or behind other windows. They are laid out so that I can see them all. Emacs is a very much like a Windows Manager and in one video I watched about it the presenter said that they use Emacs as a Windows Manager replacement.

Whilst I enjoy writing in Neovim the fact that it is a text editor at heart means that it always feels a bit like everything else is shoe-horned into it to try to add functionality. Making it into a replacement for something like VS Code works but it all feels a bit clumsy. Maybe Emacs will suit me better.

## Learning The Basics

I tend to learn best from books (ideally physical) and whilst I know that the official Emacs guide can be downloaded and printed out I wanted something a bit less dry.

Modern Emacs books tend not to be a thing so I picked a comparatively recent book from 2015, [Harley Hahn's Emacs Field Guide](https://www.harley.com/emacs/index.html). However it is only after the first 70 pages that Emacs gets installed and you are ready to start using it. This is a book with some very obvious padding and it all feels like the author has recycled content from other books they have written about Linux.

Fortunately a colleague told me about [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) which is both much more recently written and much better at getting to the point. It is only available as an ebook so at the moment I am reading it on my iPad whilst I tinker on my laptop but I may get a physical copy printed.

There are also a plethora of video on YouTube and the ones which seem to have clicked the best with me are ones by [System Crafters](https://www.youtube.com/c/systemcrafters).

And then of course there are blog posts and places like Stack Overflow too. And this blog too where I can keep notes to remind myself about the things I learn.
