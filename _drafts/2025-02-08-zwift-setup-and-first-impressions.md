## Introduction

Just over a week ago my [Zwift Ride with Kickr Core](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-ride-kickr-core) was delivered. I'm not intending to review it (I've nothing to compare it to for a start and my expertise in this field is pretty much zero) or [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) itself, rather I'm going to describe my experience of setting up an environment for it and using it from the perspective of someone with pretty much zero fitness.

## The Pain Cave

Apparently the term for the room where you do things like indoor cycling is a pain cave. Mine is the room which was used by my daughter as her snug/study whilst she was at school. After she finished it became more of a junk room (a box room if I'm being polite) and now it is my pain cave.

The Zwift Ride itself was easy to set up, even for someone who is not very dextrous. I followed their setup videos which were very clear and easy to follow. I also initially followed their advice about seat and handlebar positions based on your height. More on this below.

As well as the indoor trainer itself I bought Zwift's [training mat](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-training-mat) (the room is carpeted and I really didn't want sweat dripping onto the floor) and their [tablet holder](https://uk.zwift.com/products/zwift-ride-tablet-holder) so that I could be up and running with Zwift easily on my iPad and then, if I switched to a TV, use my iPad for watching or listening to other things during rides.

The other things I bought right at the start were a fan and a [Wahoo TICKR FIT](https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/heart-rate-monitors#fit-sec) Heart Rate Armband.

The fan is important because you do get very hot when riding indoors since there is no breeze to help cool you down. I bought a [Vacmaster Cardio54 Fitness Fan](https://www.cleva-uk.com/products/vacmaster-cardio54-fan) and I bought it from the manufacturer because signing up for their newsletter gave me a 10% discount. This fan has a remote control which is incredibly useful, maybe essential, so that you can turn the fan on and off or change the level of it whilst you are riding. This fan can also be mounted on a VESA stand or on a tripod but I have it sitting on a tabletop which blows the air at torso-height. I am not sure how well it would work on the floor.

After a couple of days I decided that I wanted a larger screen than my iPad so I dug out an old computer monitor and paired it with an [Apple TV](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/). To connect all of your bits and pieces (the trainer, heart rate monitor, Zwift controls, etc.) I do need to use the Zwift Companion app on my iPhone and if you are an Android user I don't think that this is going to work so you might need to use a PC rather than an Apple TV.

> As an aside about PC vs Apple TV, perhaps the biggest advantage of a PC is that you can get a full 60FPS 4K experience whereas the Apple TV app is 30FPS and 1080p. But the Apple TV option is quick and easy to set up and use and, unless you have a powerful enough PC handy, quite a bit cheaper.

## Clothing & Accessories

In terms of clothing and accessories, I have some towels (I'm using basic hand towels) to wipe myself and the bike down with and some headbands (which I look ridiculous wearing because I don't have hair that needs holding back but they do a great job of keeping sweat out of your eyes).

Liquids are very important so I have a couple of sports water bottles handy and they allow me to drink whilst I am pedalling.

I'm only part-way there with the clothing I want. At the moment I am wearing some old cycling shorts (padded shorts help enormously because saddles are not particularly comfortable and more on this below) but I will be buying some better quality bib shorts very soon.

I am also currently wearing t-shirts but heavy, wet cotton is not pleasant so I will also be invesating in some cycling jerseys soon too. Having sweat wicking away rather than lingering in my top will be a lovely improvement!

At some point I will probably change to clipless pedals and cycling shoes but for now I'm using the flat pedals that come with the Zwift Ride and my trainers and they are fine for the sorts of rides I am doing at the moment.

## The First Few Rides

My very first ride was as soon as I had assembled the bike. I intended to do a few gentle minutes just to see what Zwift (the app) was about and to make sure everything worked. I was wearing my jeans and slippers. I ended up riding Volcano Circuit, a fairly flat 6km loop. 12 minutes later I had sweat pouring off me and, my legs were so wobbly that I went downstairs on my bottom because I didn't trust them. But there was something very addictive about it all so my intentions of a gentle, slow ride vanished into me pushing myself harder than I probably should have done.

As expected, the biggest casualty of this was my bottom. Bike saddles can be bad enough for regular cyclists but for new ones it is a whole world of pain. By the next day everything was still very tender. However I'd dug out the old cycling shorts by then so decided to just have a quick go to see if they helped.

16 minutes and 7km later I'd complete another loop of Volcano Circuit (I'm not entirely sure why the distance was longer other than this was a Pacer Group ride so maybe it includes a warm up distance). I was hot and sweaty again but my legs worked marginally better at least. My bottom however was not in a good way and I have quite a lot of chaffing. But I had been aware that I was moving around on the saddle a lot and my arms were sore.

On day three I took a break to let my bottom recover a bit and I tried to find out why I had numb hands and arms after such a short distance. I found [an excellent video](https://youtu.be/sJV4WS-5Q-M) on YouTube which gave me some idea that it was reach, both my arms and legs, so on day four I lowered my saddle and brought the handlebars closer.

Then I rode two loops of Volcano Circuit and at the end of the 12km I was still very hot and tired but I was a lot less sore everywhere. I'd been aware that I'd not been shifting around so much and the whole thing was much more comfortable. That's not to say that everything was perfect and there was still some tenderness but it was a lot better than it had been.

Since then I have done two more rides on days six and eight, both finally on new routes, and the discomfort of cycling is being replaced by even more panting and sweating. I'm slowly adapting to the saddle and bike in general and so the suffering is moving towards being fitness related which is how it should be.
