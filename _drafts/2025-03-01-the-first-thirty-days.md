title: Seeing The Difference

It has been a few weeks since [I first wrote](2025-02-08-changing-my-lifestyle) about the changes I was making to my lifestyle and so it is time for an update.

## Weight and Diet

I started measuring my weight properly on the 19th of January when I was 101.5 kg. Since then I have done weekly weigh-ins on Sunday mornings and today I weighed myself and I was down to ... There is still a long way to go but I have noticed the difference both in how I look in the mirror and in how my clothes fit. Last weekend I put on my jeans, did up my belt and moved to the next notch which was very satisfying!

Over the last few weeks I have successfully cut out the unhealthy snacks I used to eat. Out have gone the multipacks and sharing bags of crisps, out have gone the sweets, out have gone the impromptu late-night sandwiches. I've been much more conscious about eating fruit, some raw carrots or a handfull of nuts instead. I've not really had any cravings and a key element is definitely not having bad snacks in my house. When my daughter came home from university for a couple of days we had some in the house and when she left I quite deliberately threw the reamining bits and pieces out.

In terms of meals themselves I've been very conscious about cutting out ready-meals and trying to avoid ultra-processed foods as much as I can. I've not eaten very much meat in the  last few weeks and when I have it has either been chicken or fish. I've not eaten bread and brown rice has replaced potatoes in a lot of my meals. Fortunately I do like salads and because they are quick and easy to put together I've been eating them a few times a week for suppers too.

However I'm not going to deprive myself of everything. If I have an urge for a pizza or a fish finger sandwich I'm not going to fight it; I just need to make sure that they are treats and not regular meals.

I am not calorie-counting but I have had days where I have counted them up to check that I am not too far off where I should be and fortunately I've been getting things pretty much right so far.

## Exercise

All of my exercise so far has been indoor cycling on my Zwift Ride. Between getting it and today I've spent xxx hours riding ... km.

## General Wellbeing

In general I'm physically and mentally feeling a lot better than I did at the start of 2025. I tend to ache less in general and getting out of bed feels less of a struggle (which sounds pathetic for someone in their early 50s but odd aches and pains were a thing). I am more flexible and, in another terrible confession, bending down to pick up things like cat bowls had been a conscious effort (not a huge one but enough of one to notice) whereas now my knees seem to work a lot better and my back is more flexible.

I do think that I need to add some strength training to the mix now and I am also keen to try yoga or Pilates to increase my flexibility further.

A warning for the next two paragraph about my body shape because it may be too much information for some people!

My general body shape still isn't great and I obviously still have a large belly but where there used to be a fold of fat at the bottom of it, it is now just a rounded lump. I am hoping that the crease marks will eventually fade a bit and I am hoping that the skin was not stretched so far that I will end up with loose skin there. It may happen as I loose more weight however and I'm accepting that as a worthwhile trade-off.

My breasts are also the other area where I have a lot of fat. They too have shrunk a bit and again I am hoping that I don't have too much loose skin there but time will tell.


## My Final Thoughts
