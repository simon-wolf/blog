It has been 30 days since my Zwift Ride was delivered and I had that tentative first ride in jeans and slippers. Whilst I'm not going to do this on a regular basis, I though I'd post some information about how the first 30 days have gone for me.

## Weight

I started measuring my weight properly a few days before my indoor cycling kit arrived. I weigh myself every Sunday morning and yes, I do sometimes have to fight the urge to do extra checks.

My first weigh-in was on Sunday 19 January when I was 101.5 kg. My most recent one was on Sunday 23 February (see no cheating since the next one is tomorrow) and my weight was down to ...

My dietary changes are still going well and it's been around six weeks since I ate any crisps, sweets, cakes, or things that I knew were likely to be bad for me and I've also pretty much given up eating bread too.

## Cycling

Indoor cycling doesn't get easier, you just get faster but just as sweaty and out of breath.

However, as a comparison, this morning I repeated the first ever ride I did and the details are below. Unfortunately my heart rate monitor had not arrived when I did the ride originally so one of the key bits of information is missing. I have therefore inserted the data from my second ever ride which was a very slightly longer version of the same route and where the other data is so close that it is a reasonable yardstick.

## Walking And Running


## General Wellness

In general I'm physically and mentally feeling a lot better than I did at the start of 2025. I tend to ache less in general and getting out of bed feels less of a struggle (which sounds pathetic for someone in their early 50s but odd aches and pains were a thing). I am more flexible and, in another terrible confession, bending down to pick up things like cat bowls had been a conscious effort (not a huge one but enough of one to notice) whereas now my knees seem to work a lot better and my back is more flexible.

I do think that I need to add some strength training to the mix now and I am also keen to try yoga or Pilates to increase my flexibility further.

A warning for the next two paragraph about my body shape because it may be too much information for some people!

My general body shape still isn't great and I obviously still have a large belly but where there used to be a fold of fat at the bottom of it, it is now just a rounded lump. I am hoping that the crease marks will eventually fade a bit and I am hoping that the skin was not stretched so far that I will end up with loose skin there. It may happen as I loose more weight however and I'm accepting that as a worthwhile trade-off.

My breasts are also the other area where I have a lot of fat. They too have shrunk a bit and again I am hoping that I don't have too much loose skin there but time will tell.
