I very rarely eat breakfast. I might if I am in a hotel but then it has tended to be a [Full English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast) just because it's a treat. But I never really feel hungry so I spend the morning drinking a few cups of (terrible, instant) coffee and eat my first meal at around 1pm. But breakfast is meant to be the most important meal of the day so I've been trying something new for the last couple of weeks.

## The Most Important Meal?

The perceived wisdom (I'm basing this on various articles but the two most pertinent are from [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/breakfast-lose-weight) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20181126-is-breakfast-good-for-your-health)) is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast kick-starts your metabolism and improves your energy levels and ability to focus. It can help lower levels of bad LDL cholestrol, and lower the chances of getting diabetes, heart disease, and being overweight (presumably as long as you are not eating a Full English every day that is).

Eating breakfast is meant to help the body's rythm of fasting and eating, restore blood sugar levels and generally kick-start you for the day. When you sleep your body uses energy stores for growth and repair so breakfast helps replenish protein and calcium used throughout the night. Not eating breakfast can starve your body and may lead to over-eating later in the day.

But the flip-side of this is that the sugar content of cereal (the most popular breakfast) is not good and the food industry's involvement in research around the benefits of breakfast might not be producing impartial reports into the benefits.

According to the BBC article, there really isn't enough evidence to provide any link between eating or not eating breakfast and obesity. Similarly, there is back-and-forth about the benefits of not eating breakfast and essentially fasting.

But one interesting bit of information for me was that people who skip breakfast and eat late are not getting any of the benefits of fasting but they also have a higher risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our body's blood sugar control is better in the morning so eating a larger breakfast (or lunch) and a smaller evening meal is beneficial.

So I decided to try eating breakfast and, whilst not the focus of this post, I also decided to swap my lighter lunches (usually soup) with my heavier suppers.

## What To Have

I knew I didn't want to have cereal for breakfast but since I have so little experience of eating breakfasts I didn't know what I wanted or should have. If I'm abroad on holiday then I do enjoy a breakfast of meats and cheeses and eggs and fruit but, at least whilst I'm dieting, I'm trying to cut out cheese and my meat intake is down significantly too. Things like scrambled eggs on toast are definitely an option but I have pretty much cut bread out of my diet too.

But recently I had heard about overnight oats and so I decided to start with them because they seemed easy to prepare and you can have them hot or cold and mix them with a whole range of "extras".

Overnight oats are what the name suggests... rolled oats soaked in dairy or non-dairy milk, or even water, overnight. You can also mix in things like [chia seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_seed), which are high in fibre, or yoghurt, both of which which will give you a smoother, creamer texture. And then, in the morning you can add toppings like nuts, seeds, fruit or something like nut butter.

## First Impressions 

After doing some searching on the web for ideas [I found one](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/pbj-overnight-oats) I was pretty sure I'd like, raspberries and peanut butter, albeit in a combination I never thought I would try.

The night before I mixed the oats, frozen raspberries, skimmed milk, and a pinch of salt and left it covered in the fridge. A couple of hours later I peered at it and really wasn't sure that any of this was a good idea! It looked pretty unappetising. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.

The next morning it looked a lot better. The raspberries has thawed and largely broken down and been absorbed into the now softened, creamy-looking oats. I stirred in a teaspoon of [smooth almond butter](https://www.pipandnut.com/products/smooth-almond-butter-jar) and a drizzle of honey and gave it all a good stir.

Still not sure about whether I should heat it up or not, with some trepidation, I took an initial mouthful. And it was really delicious. Millions of people were not wrong!

After eating I felt completely full and, even for someone used to large portion sizes, it felt like I'd eaten a lot. ...
