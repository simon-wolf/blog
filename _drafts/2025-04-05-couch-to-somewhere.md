title: Couch To... Somewhere...
categories: health
---

On Monday I did something I've never done before. I voluntarilly, for pleasure and exercise, went for a (kind of) run. I started Couch To 5K.

It must be 35 or more years since I last ran for exercise and back then it would have been teenage me doing PE at school. Since then I might have broken out into a bit of a run to catch a bus or train, probably to retrieve a wayward toddler as she made a bid for freedom under the lax supervision of her father and, most recently, 30 seconds on a treadmill when I was [buying my running shoes](https://blog.sgawolf.com/post/2025-02-08-changing-my-lifestyle).

## School: An Education... In Hating Exercise

At school I was not a sporty person. I wasn't good at sports and I was never given help or encouragement to improve. The pupils who were good at sports got help, support, and encouragement whilst people like me were seen as the no-hopers; we were the ones who were always picked last for teams. It was a weird mix of humiliation and discouragement. I'm not entirely surprised that I've never seen exercise in a positive way or that it has taken me decades to start to embrace it. 

## 35 Years Later

Without repeating things I've said in previous posts about the journey I've recently started, one of the things I've had a strong urge to do since I started is doing a Parkrun. It might end up being just one or it might be a regular thing. I might run half-marathons or full marathons or ultra-marathons. Who knows? But I have an initial goal to run 5K and it's become a bit of a weird obsession since I have never enjoyed running.

## Couch To 5K

Couch to 5K is a way to go from not running to being able to run 5 kilometers or at least run for 30 minnutes non-stop. It gradually migrates, over nine weeks, from walking with a bit of running to running with a bit of walking to just running.

There are all sorts of plans you can follow and slightly different approaches but I, like probably a lot of people in the UK, am following the one [created by the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/get-active/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/). There is a good smartphone app you can use which talks you through the sessions and they also provide [a useful PDF document](https://digitalcampaignsstorage.blob.core.windows.net/campaigns-cms-prod/documents/c25k_printable_plan.pdf) which defines the plan. This is very handy, but more on that later.

## All The Gear, Some Idea

As well as [my running shoes](https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/gt-2000-13-lite-show/p/1011B953-001.html) (and I really recommend going to get proper running shoes and not just using any old pair of trainers, particularly if you are older, heavier or liable to suffer an injury) I've got some [tracksuit bottoms](https://www.marksandspencer.com/drawstring-cotton-rich-straight-leg-joggers/p/clp60618647?color=DARKNAVY), [long-sleeved running tops](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/care-men-s-long-sleeved-breathable-running-t-shirt-royal-blue/_/R-p-325868?mc=8881698&c=burgundy+purple_burgundy+purple), a lightweight fleece (this is an old work one so no link I'm afraid), a [running belt](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0D1VK9VRH) for keys, phone, etc., my iPhone and some [bone conducting headphones](https://uk.shokz.com/products/openrun-pro2).

In addition, I'm using my [Garmin Fenix 7](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/735520) to manage the sessions. This is where the PDF plan is useful because the information it provides allows me to create a workout plan in the Garmin Connect app (I found [this](https://youtu.be/wYD1hFxSqNI) video useful) which I can then sync with my phone. I then start that and, as quickly as possible, start the session on the Couch to 5K app too.

The reason for this is that the Couch to 5K app is great for encouragement and talking you through the sessions but I can see myself needing that less and less. But more importantly for me, it doesn't provide any tracking about your runs and I love this sort of data. By doing the workout on my Garmin I can collect a lot of data to review and I can also sync it with [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) to help build up an overall view of my exercise (Zwift can also sync data with Strava).

## One Small Step...

As someone who is new to exercise and who is very self-aware about their lack of fitness and ability, just stepping out of my front door to go and do the first session was intimidating. What if people laugh at me? What if I can't do any of it and give up after a few minutes? What if I can't run at all? What happens if I see someone I know? The doubts go on and on. But I had picked a day, the 31st of March, and I was determined to stick to it. Worse case, I could pretend that I was out for a walk in some slightly unusual clothing for me.

So at around 6pm I walked up to the recreation field. The warm-up is a walk so this was fine. And the field was largely empty apart from a few young children playing and a joyous sight... someone doing some intermittent walking and running which was very possibly someone else doing COuch to 5K. Suddenly it all felt a bit more possible. But even without that I was remembering the words that doing something is better than doing nothing and I was doing something and felt empowered by it.

There were doubts and worries however. On the walk to the field I probably marched a bit too enthusistically and my groin (sorry!) was sore. And when I started running my lower back was painful. The ground was lumpy and my running form...
