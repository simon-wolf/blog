title: How Much Is My Health Worth
categories: health
---

At the end of my [last blog post](2025-03-02-seeing-the-difference) I said that I would talk about the costs involved in the fitness journey I am going on. Before I even look at the figures properly I know that it is not cheap and that I have more expense ahead. But there are cheaper (and more expensive) ways to do a similar thing so do not consider the figures below to be definitive and definitely don't see them as a barrier to starting a similar journey yourself because a comfy pair of shoes will allow you to start walking and that can be the literal and metaphorical first step.

Just be prepared that if you make a decision like me and decide to take up something like indoor cycling then there are a range of accessories and extras you may also choose to buy. They are not compulsory (although doing indoor cycling in jeans and slippers is not recommended) but you may just find yourself making similar purchases as me.

## Weight Loss

I bought myself some smart scales and went for [RENPHO ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDF4QCR2) which were £22.94. They are good but I do sometimes have to reboot my iPhone to get it to pair with the scales so that the data can be synchronised with the RENPHO iPhone app (which also shares data with the Apple Health app).

## Cycling

By far the biggest single expense has been the [Zwift Ride with Kickr Core](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-ride-kickr-core) which is £1,199.99. I did get a 10% discount bringing it down to £1,080.00) that thanks to a discount code I got from (the now infamous on my blog) Ryan Condon via [his referral link](https://zwiftinc.sjv.io/DybyQj) and the code RYANZWIFT10.

I also bought a [Zwift Training Mat](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-training-mat?variant=43340241862896) and a [Zwift Tablet Holder](https://uk.zwift.com/products/zwift-ride-tablet-holder?variant=45963971199216) for £79.99 and £39.99 respectively but sadly the discount code did not apply to "accessories". I'd definitely buy the mat again but probably not the tablet holder since I now use a monitor and my iPad, whilst used to watch stuff whilst I ride, sits on the same desk as the monitor. 

And of course there is a Zwift subscription which is £17.99 per month or £179.99 for a year. I opted to pay for a year because of the small discount and because, if I do waver, hopefully my conscience will nag at me. I'm also expecting to Zwift all-year rather than it being a winter thing so I should get good value out of it,

The [Cleva Vacmaster Cardio54](https://www.cleva-uk.com/products/vacmaster-cardio54-fan) fan was £99.99 but by buying from Cleva and signing up for their newsletter I I got a 10% discount code.

I use an Apple TV hooked up to a monitor for Zwift itself and whilst I had an old 27" monitor I needed to buy a new [Apple TV 4K](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/) because my old, unused ones are ancient. That cost me £149.00.

My Giordana bib shorts from [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/giordana/giordana-men-s-fr-c-pro-5cm-shorter-bib-short-forest-green/_/R-p-a6aebf68-455c-4de4-96bf-13ce7b17da89?mc=a6aebf68-455c-4de4-96bf-13ce7b17da89_c15&c=bordeaux#selectedSize=2XL) cost £87.98 (£83.99 plus £3.99 shipping) and were reduced from £119.99.

I also bought two cycling jerseys from [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-breathable-mtb-jersey/_/R-p-327890?mc=8772459&c=green_meleze%20green) which were £28.97 (£12.99 each plus £2.99 shipping). 

I am going to get some clipless cycling shoes and in anticipation of that I bought some Shimano PD-RS500 SPD-SL pedals and Shimano SM-SH11 SPD-SL Yellow cleats from [Halfords](https://www.halfords.com/) and cost £37.99 (reduced from £59.99) and £12.99 (reduced from £20.99) respectively. I have yet to buy cycling shoes for them but expect those to be around £120.

I bought three [hand towels](https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-ultra-soft-cotton-towels/hibiscus-pink/p5399715) at £8.00 each and a [1 litre drinks bottle](https://www.johnlewis.com/ion8-motivation-leak-proof-recyclon-drinks-bottle-1l/ice/p6282498) for £14.00 from John Lewis. One or two towels would have sufficed.

Whilst I have yet to get the shoes to go with them, I've bought some [Danish Endurance Cycling Socks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BKLCKT91) from Amazon for £29.99 (this is for two pairs) and I have also bought some [headbands](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08S384T5Z) for £6.07.

My heart rate monitor is a [Wahoo TICKR FIT Heart Rate Armband](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B078GRMFSN) which was £56.49.

## Running

My running purchases so far have been limited to a pair of running shoes and some socks.

The running shoes are [Asics GT-2000 13 Lite](https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/gt-2000-13-lite-show/p/1011B953-001.html) which I bought from [Runners Need](https://www.runnersneed.com/p/asics-mens-gt-2000-13-lite-show-shoes-C22AGB0097.html?colour=3607) for £140.00.

The socks are [Danish Endurance Grip Socks With Ankle Support](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B12SCY8L) for £19.95 (which is for two pairs).

## The Luxury Treat

By day I am a software developer and I love tech and gadgets. I knew that I wanted to get a fitness watch of some description and for a brief while I was looking at sensible options. I bought a [Garmin Fenix 7](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/735611) and found the 47mm Pro Sapphire Solar one for £609 at [WATCHO](https://www.watcho.co.uk/watches/garmin/garmin-fenix-7-pro-47mm-sapphire-solar-titanium-carbon-grey-dlc-black-watch-010-02777-11/).

## Still To Buy

There are a couple things I need to get.

As mentioned above, the main one is some clipless cycling shoes.

When I start Couch to 5K I will need to get some shorts but to start with I do have some tracksuit bottoms. I'll also need some running tops but could start in my cycling jerseys I think.

## Is It Worth It? Am I Worth It?

Yes.

And that was really easy to write.

I realise that this can all be done more cheaply but it can also be done more extravagantly too. I could have gone and bought a bike for more than all of this has cost me... and then I'd probably never ride it because I'd not be fit or confident enough to go out an get fit and confident.

But you definitely don't need to spend a lot to go on the same journey I have embarked upon. Whatever you can afford and however you do it, whether it is for yourself, for your family and friends, or just to help society, make a start,
