title: How Much Is Health Worth
categories: health
---

At the end of my [last blog post](2025-03-02-seeing-the-difference) I said that I would talk about the costs involved in the fitness journey I am going on. Before I even look at the figures properly I know that it is not cheap and that I have more expense ahead. But there are cheaper (and more expensive) ways to do a similar thing so do not consider the figures below to be definitive and definitely don't see them as a barrier to starting a similar journey yourself because a comfy pair of shoes will allow you to start walking and that can be the literal and metaphorical first step.

## General Purchases

I bought myself some smart scales and went for [RENPHO ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDF4QCR2) which were £22.94. They are good but I do sometimes have to reboot my iPhone to get it to pair with the scales so that the data can be synched with the RENPHO iPhone app (which also shares data with the Apple Health app).

## Cycling

By far the biggest single expense has been the [Zwift Ride with Kickr Core](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-ride-kickr-core) which is £1,199.99. I did get a 10% discount bringing it down to £1,080.00) that thanks to a discount code I got from (the now infamous on my blog) Ryan Condon via [his referral link](https://zwiftinc.sjv.io/DybyQj) and the code RYANZWIFT10.

I also bought a [Zwift Training Mat](https://uk.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-training-mat?variant=43340241862896) and a [Zwift Tablet Holder](https://uk.zwift.com/products/zwift-ride-tablet-holder?variant=45963971199216) for £79.99 and £39.99 respectively but sadly the discount code did not work for "accessories". I'd definitely buy the mat again but probably not the tablet holder since I now use a monitor and my iPad, whilst used to watch stuff whilst I ride, sits on the same desk as the monitor. 

And of course there is a Zwift subscription which is £17.99 per month or £179.99 for a year. I'm just approaching the end of an initial free month and will probably pay monthly for a little while but I'm 99.9% sure II'm going to be sticking with Zwift so will switch to annual billing.

The [Cleva Vacmaster Cario54](https://www.cleva-uk.com/products/vacmaster-cardio54-fan) fan was £99.99 but bybuying from Cleva and signing up for their newsletter I I got a 10% discount code.

I use an Apple TV hooked up to a monitor for Zwift itself and whilst I had an old 27" monitor I needed to buy a new [Apple TV 4K](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/) because my old, unused ones are ancient. That cost me £149.00.

My Giordana bib shorts from [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/giordana/giordana-men-s-fr-c-pro-5cm-shorter-bib-short-forest-green/_/R-p-a6aebf68-455c-4de4-96bf-13ce7b17da89?mc=a6aebf68-455c-4de4-96bf-13ce7b17da89_c15&c=bordeaux#selectedSize=2XL) cost £87.98 (£83.99 plus £3.99 shipping) and were reduced from £119.99.

My Shimano PD-RS500 SPD-SL pedals and Shimano SM-SH11 SPD-SL Yellow cleats were bought from [Halfords](https://www.halfords.com/) and cost £37.99 (reduced from £59.99) and £12.99 (reduced from £20.99) respectively. I have yet to buy cycling shoes for them but expect those to be around £120.

I bought three [hand towels](https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-ultra-soft-cotton-towels/hibiscus-pink/p5399715) at £8.00 each and a [1 litre drinks bottle](https://www.johnlewis.com/ion8-motivation-leak-proof-recyclon-drinks-bottle-1l/ice/p6282498) for £14.00 from John Lewis. One or two towels would have sufficed.

Whilst I have yet to get the shoes to go with them, I've bought some [Danish Endurance Cycling Socks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BKLCKT91) from Amazon for £29.99 (this is for two pairs) and I have also bought some [headbands](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08S384T5Z) for £6.07.

My heart rate monitor is a [Wahoo TICKR FIT Heart Rate Armband](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B078GRMFSN) which was £56.49.

As well as cycling shoes I also want to buy a couple of cycling jerseys which will be more comfortable to ride in that cotton t-shirts.

## Running

My running purchases so far have been limited to a pair of running shoes and some socks.

The running shoes are [Asics GT-2000 13 Lite](https://www.asics.com/gb/en-gb/gt-2000-13-lite-show/p/1011B953-001.html) which I bought from [Runners Need](https://www.runnersneed.com/p/asics-mens-gt-2000-13-lite-show-shoes-C22AGB0097.html?colour=3607) for £140.00.

The socks are [Danish Endurance Grip Socks With Ankle Support](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B12SCY8L) for £19.95 (which is for two pairs).

## Still To Buy

There are a few things I still need to get.

The main one is some clipless cycling shoes and then I need to get some cycling jerseys.

When I start Couch to 5K I will need to get some shorts but to start with I do have some tracksuit bottoms.

## Might Get At Some Point

I'm tempted to switch my Zwifting to a PC or Mac so that I can take advantage of the higher resolution graphics at a higher frame rate. I may be able to do this on a 2009 iMac I have, otherwise it will be another £599 for a [Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac-mini/).

For running I'm sure I'll be tempted by a sports watch and whilst I would traditionally lean towards an Apple Watch I think I'll probably buy a Garmin one. However this isn't something I have really researched yet but I'll estimate around £600 for this.
