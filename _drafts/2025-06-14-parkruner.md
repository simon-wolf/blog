After my recent [knee injury](2025-06-05-kneeded-to-rest) I finally started running again a couple of weeks ago and finished the Couch to 5K program, albeit with the last week of it spread over two weeks. I think I'm probably fairly normal in that I finished being able to run non-stop for 30 minutes rather than managing to run a full 5K distance in that time. But I then discovered that there are some extra sessions added on to the plan, the first of which is a 35 minute run. With my running pace hovering around seven minutes per kilometre I finally managed to run a full 5K distance on that run, meaning that within a few days I'd managed to complete the core plan and also hit a 5K distance. It also meant that I was mentally more comfortable about taking part in my first Parkrun.
