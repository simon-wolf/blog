### Summary

This is the license agreement for my source code. Fear not, you’re allowed to use it in your own products, commercial, open-source or anything else.

The full license text is further down this page, and you should only use the source code if you agree to the terms in that text. However, here is a quick summary, albeit non-authoritative, interpretation of the license which will hopefully answer any questions you have.

* You can modify the code as you wish, and use the modified code in your products.
* You can redistribute the original, unmodified code, but you have to include the full license text.
* You can redistribute the modified code as you wish without the full license text.
In all cases, you must include a credit mentioning Simon Wolf as the original author of the source.
* I’m not liable for anything you do with the code.
* I’m not responsible for any harm the code may cause.
* You can’t use my name or other marks to promote your products based on the code.
* If you agree to all of that, go ahead and download the source. Otherwise, don’t.

### Compatibility
This license is borrowed from Matt Gemmell with his permission and is a version of the new BSD license, and should be compatible with that license. If you’d like me to give you special permission to use any of my code under another license (like BSD, or the GPL, or something else), just contact me and we will work something out.

### Suggested Attribution Format
The license requires that you give credit to me, Simon Wolf, as the original author of any of the code that you use. The placement and format of the credit is up to you, but I prefer the credit to be in the software’s ‘About’ window. Alternatively, you could put the credit in the software’s documentation, or on the web page for the product. The suggested format for the attribution is:

***Includes “Name of Code” code by Simon Wolf.***

where “Name of Code” would obviously be replaced by the name of the specific source-code package you made use of. Where possible, please link the text “Simon Wolf” to [my business website](https://www.ottersoftware.com), or include the site’s URL ([https://www.ottersoftware.com](https://www.ottersoftware.com)).
